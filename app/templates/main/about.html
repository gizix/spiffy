                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <p>
                    Spiffy uses the official Spotify Web API to fetch data about your listening habits.
                    Your data is stored in a local SQLite database, so you maintain complete control over your information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Randomizer creates smarter shuffled playlists by applying customizable rules to your
                    music library. Unlike Spotify's basic shuffle, our system lets you control exactly how your playlists
                    are generated, with options to limit artists, balance music from different eras, and create the perfect
                    mix for any occasion. Other than the random number generator, no other algorithms are used to shuffle
                    your tracks for a truly random shuffle.
                </p>

                <h4>Privacy</h4>
                <p>
                    We take your privacy seriously. Your Spotify data is stored locally and is not shared with any third parties.
                    You can delete your account and all associated data at any time.
                </p>

                <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python with Flask web framework</li>
                    <li>SQLite for data storage</li>
                    <li>Spotipy for Spotify API integration</li>
